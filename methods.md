Our plan was to design and create a website detailing our findings and promote it through the UCSD ECE undergraduate newsletter. We did extensive research using JSTOR, newspaper articles, interviews, and other digital resources to educate ourselves and prepare material on the different aspects of the issue. Our project only used resources that were free or provided by the university, so other students could replicate a similar project if they desired. Aside from the aforementioned sources, we used GitHub Pages to host a site and our own personal computers to develop the work and site.
