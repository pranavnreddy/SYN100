        <div class="post-content"><h2 id="what-were-the-resultsoutcomes-of-your-project">What were the results/outcomes of your project?</h2>
<p>We hope that we brought awareness to the problems mining has on both the environment and the people associated with the land or industry. We have both learned a lot about the problems associated with mining in countries with poor labor laws. We have provided some potential solutions that could be incorporated to lessen the impact this practice has on the environment. Although these solutions will take a lot of time, effort, and money to implement, we hope that this industry practices safer environmental/humanitarian laws in the near future.</p>
<h2 id="were-there-any-surprises-what-did-you-learn-from-those-surprises">Were there any surprises? What did you learn from those surprises?</h2>
<p>What I found most surprising was the undeveloped policies to prevent the purchasing of coltan from groups associated with human rights abuse in the DRC. In the mining of other ores like cobalt in the DRC multinational companies have come together to create safer purchasing environments. I learned that even though these metals are being mined in the same part of the world, regulating people not attached to a specific company makes the purchasing of ethical sources difficult.</p>
<h2 id="was-there-anything-that-you-planned-on-doing-that-either-didnt-work-or-you-didnt-have-time-for">Was there anything that you planned on doing that either didn’t work or you didn’t have time for?</h2>
<p>We did not have time to interview more professors that we believed would give a different perspective to our topic. We also did not have enough time to get our website into the newsletter before presenting our deliverable.</p>
<h2 id="how-could-yours-or-a-future-syn-100-team-continue-this-project-what-should-they-be-aware-of-if-they-were-to-continue-this-project">How could yours or a future SYN 100 team continue this project? What should they be aware of if they were to continue this project?</h2>
<p>We hope to continue building the website and interview a diverse range of researchers/professors from different fields to get a wider perspective on what can be done to spread awareness about unethical harvesting practices of raw materials. We hope to refine our website and eventually get it in the electrical/computer engineering newsletter to get feedback from our intended audience. I would hope that if a SYN100 team continued this project that they would use their social networks to interview with other researchers/professors who are familiar with this field.</p>
<p>From a more technical perspective, we would also like to fix some of the bugs, especially on the mobile version, and add more interactive elements that could let users engage with our research better, such as a quiz, game, or some other active element.</p>
<h2 id="optional-recommendations-further-directions">Optional: recommendations/ further directions</h2>
<p>To completely finish up this project during the summer session we could have used a bit more time or more people in our group. If someone were to pick up from where we left off, I’d recommend having someone who is familiar with GitHub. It would also be nice to have a diverse group of majors to see the different perspectives they or their professors might have related to the topic.</p>
