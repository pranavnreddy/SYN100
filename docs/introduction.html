        <div class="post-content"><p>Our group wanted to focus on how the environment is being impacted by the outsourcing of mining labor. We are focusing on two materials lithium and coltan that are heavily demanded by the tech industry. Focusing on these two materials gives us important insight on how mining is affecting the environment. Looking at the devastating effect mining has had on the local community and environment, of resources that are deemed vital to the progress of renewable energy proposes the question: is there such a thing as fair trade? These miners or locals only face the repercussions of these mining operations but do not gain any of the benefits. The people who benefit from the efforts of renewable energy are those who live in first world countries. The aim for this project is to bring about awareness to electrical engineering students on the unethical sourcing of electrical components and how they impact the environment and subsequently the local communities.
The extreme demand for natural resources and labor causes deforestation, pollution, and many other things contributing to climate change while impacting the poorest disproportionately. The countries that are outsourced donâ€™t have as strong labor protections or social infrastructure for people with disabilities or environmental protections. Our goal is to spread awareness of this topic to electrical engineering students in hope that they might gain a more ethical awareness or might pursue a career in the underdeveloped battery recycling industry to institute change.</p>
