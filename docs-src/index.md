# SYN 100

We are two students, Clayton (Economics) and Pranav (Electrical Engineering), in the Synthesis program interested in the intersection of disability, labor, and the electronics industry. If you are an EE major, please think about how your depth depends on labor overseas and let us know what you think. 

# Executive Summary

One of the main drivers of climate change is the extremely disproportionate level of consumption in the western world. This disparity in consumption between developed and less developed countries is partly due to a global system of labor in which cheaper labor overseas enables the extraction of resources for consumption in the western world. A classic example is the electronics industry, which greatly depends on the mining of a variety of minerals from all over the world, such as lithium in Chile, coltan in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and rare earth elements in China. This inequality produces and harms disabled people directly through labor as well as through peripheral industries and environmental effects. The disparity contributes to the production and experience of disability in the third world, which has been relatively underexplored and we hope to shed light on the global and local nature of this issue.
