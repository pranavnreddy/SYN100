## Transcript

__Clayton (00:04):__
Yeah. So my first question was are there any misconceptions about your role as an environmental economist?

__Professor Jacobsen (00:13):__
Sure. So I think that oftentimes folks interested in environmental protection sometimes that think that environmental economists are going to be more in favor of development or of increasing GDP or something like that. I think there's a misconception that economics only measures GDP. In fact, of course, economics measures wellbeing and part of human wellbeing is our enjoyment of things like leisure time or the environment or our health or whatever. So these things aren't necessarily measured in GDP, but you could have a society that's much better off because if people are healthier and have more free time and have cleaner air. And so the question is how do we measure that? And a lot of environmental economics concerns itself with measuring that. I think another misconception is that it's problematic to measure what I just mentioned – that we're trying to measure the value of these environmental amenities – and then we're going to compare the value of environmental quality with the value of whatever the product is that you can produce by destroying that environmental quality, in an attempt to sort decide which is the more desirable thing to have. And I think there's, if it's a misconception or not, but there's a belief that by valuing environmental amenities or valuing a species or valuing the sort of wellbeing of animals, something like that, that we're somehow doing a disservice to that species or that piece of the environment. And that's debatable. That's more philosophical. There's this point is that economics is fundamentally a human-centered discipline. Most of the social sciences are. And so we're thinking about how to make life better for humans, but if we want to assign some intrinsic value to other things on the planet that would be there, even if all the humans we're gone, that gets beyond the realm of economics. Right.

__Pranav (02:18):__
Yeah. I guess as a natural follow up, can you talk a little bit about what your research specifically is focused on? I understand that a lot of your research recently has been in fuel economies.

__Professor Jacobsen (02:30):__
Yeah, so I've been thinking about transportation. Most recently I've been looking at heavy duty trucks and thinking about pollution from diesel fuel, a lot of which is very inequitably distributed, particularly in California. I know there's a lot of attention, for example, has been given to pollution near the ports and near other sort of heavy duty trucking corridors. And so then the question is how do we get zero emissions trucks potentially using some sort of clean fuel, maybe battery electric, maybe hydrogen electric? How do we get those on the road and how do we get them in places that will clean up the air where we most want to? So that's been another part of what I'm doing recently. And I also have some new work thinking about subsidization of used electric vehicles. So until now, most of the subsidies to electric vehicles have been on brand new ones.

And there's a concern that that goes mostly to wealthy people buying brand new EVs. And we want to do something about trying to subsidize the transaction of a used EV somehow, to try and spread them out more across the income distribution. And I've been trying to think some about it. What are the implications on the asset values of EVs when you put these subsidies in place? Who collects those gains and asset value and how does it affect equity, not just kind of at the very last moment when the person buying used EV actually gets their check from the government? That obviously has a gain to that individual, but all these asset price changes beforehand could sort of unintentionally presumably end up helping pretty much that first wave of wealthy EV buyers who are now looking to get rid of it and replace it with another brand new one, and now all of a sudden their asset values just went up because the person they're going to sell it to is going to be able to collect this check and so on. So trying to think about how that all plays through.

__Clayton (04:27):__
So connecting that, have you done any research on the extraction of lithium?

__Professor Jacobsen (04:37):__
Not specifically. And I think your other, the coltan, those are rare earths that are used in batteries.

__Clayton (04:44):__
Yeah. So that was my follow-up question. If so, do you think that the environmental impact that takes place during the extraction of lithium is worth the production of lithium batteries?

__Professor Jacobsen (04:53):__
So I haven't personally tried to measure the impact of lithium extraction or the extraction of these other errors, but I've seen presentations on it in conferences. I sort of interact with that literature because of course I'm interested in the other side of it, which is how to get electric vehicles on the roads and therefore clean up the air in our cities. But of course the cost of trying to clean up the air in the cities is that pollution is going to be worse in other places. And the two places that we most worry about, one are places that are near power plants. So particularly in the Midwest and the east part of the us, the coal-fired power plants and other fossil power plants are pretty far from the cities. So the electric cars clean up the cities really well, but they might make things worse in the countryside near the power plant that charges it.

And then of course the other places in the extraction of minerals to make the batteries. And in general, the production of the car. My research on this has mostly focused on the pollution associated with making gasoline vehicles rather than EVs. But interestingly, a lot of it is the same. So the steel and the glass and the tires and so on have similar pollution impacts to gasoline vehicles. Those it turns out are relatively small compared to the impact of actually burning the gasoline maybe on the order of 5%, mostly because a lot of the steel that's used in making cars is recycled and there isn't that much material in them. Now an electric car is much heavier than a gasoline car, so it just has a lot more material going in it to start with. And when there's all that extra material going in, we have to start thinking carefully about where that material came from and the pollution impacts mining. I guess my closest interaction with the terrestrial mining questions has actually been around these deep sea initiatives.

So I've sat on a few panels trying to think about the merits or not of mining the deep ocean for some of these minerals instead of taking them off of land. And it's an interesting discussion because on land we know from the science, at least in some cases, pretty much about the damage. So we can see the rivers getting destroyed and we can see the health impacts, the people who live near the mines and so on. We have reasonable measures of some of those impacts. But for deep sea mining, we have almost no measure of what the impact would be. So it's going to destroy the bottom of the deep ocean somewhere, probably stir up a bunch of dust. We don't really know what's in that dust or silt or whatever it would be in that form. We don't know much about the life down there and how badly it would suffer from these impacts. And so you're kind of comparing a really uncertain environmental problem that you get when you scrape it off the bottom of the ocean versus a problem that's at least somewhat better understood terrestrially in terms of the damage it does to health and ecosystems downstream of mines. So that's been one kind of interesting thing to think about is how do we make these comparisons when you're comparing sort of very visible known harms to much less known harms, right?

__Pranav (08:07):__
Yeah. I see. So I guess a big question in that niche is how do we measure, at least with some uncertainty, the effects of the unknown harms?

__Professor Jacobsen (08:18):__
Well, yeah. I mean the same way you measure the effects of the known ones, I suppose, which is to first start with the science and a lot of environmental economics is fairly interdisciplinary because we would rely on ecologists and marine biologists and so on to tell us something about maybe how many of these species are going to die out, how much life in terms of the biomass will be killed by mines in the ocean, let's say. And then the next step, that the economists are often more involved in, is to try to figure out how much people value those losses. And for the deep sea stuff, there's a couple of main dimensions economists have focused on. One is the opportunity costs of not ever being able to get the genetic material and the potential discoveries that could come from down there. So a lot of modern pharmaceuticals, for example, even some engineering things, come from observing novel species that we haven't seen before, understanding something about the chemistry of a novel ocean species.

Then once you understand something better about the chemistry of that species, you say, oh, I can make this drug or whatever with it. And so losing that intellectual value is one dimension that people have tried to assign dollar terms to. And then the other is existence value, which is typically used as a way of trying to assess how much people value ecosystems that they don't visit. So when we destroy an ecosystem, somebody is never going to–almost everyone–will never visit, that still actually does harm to humans because people don't like it. I'm happier knowing that the ecosystems are safe and protected than I am with them being destroyed. I might even be willing to pay a little bit of extra money when I buy a car to know that that car didn't destroy an ocean ecosystem. We do surveys to try and elicit from people how much extra they'd be willing to pay for a car that didn't destroy some ocean ecosystem. Is it $10 or $50 or $100? And then once you learn how much extra people are willing to pay, then you can add all that up and get some sense of the communal value that gets placed in the sense of how much other stuff I would give up, how much money would I give up? And therefore how much other physical products would I give up in order to know that this piece of the ocean is better off?

__Clayton (10:42):__
So I know you said that you're focused on cutting gasoline vehicles. Do you have any knowledge or are you familiar with the recycling of lithium batteries?

__Professor Jacobsen (10:57):__
Well, so again, you start with the engineering, right? So fundamentally you guys are really at an interdisciplinary space yourselves. So clearly they can be recycled, right? There are processes out there. My biggest concern I suppose, is that those processes end up being a bit more expensive than we expect, and it turns out to be cheaper to get raw material that has never been turned into a battery. And so we're doing this massive expansion of searching for new mining sites and new techniques to extract lithium from the Earth. And so suppose that stuff is really successful and now all of a sudden we've got a lot of cheap lithium. Why are we going to go to the trouble of doing an expensive recycling process to try to repurify lithium from an old battery? So I think my concern with the recycling is it won't be cheaper. It needs to be cheaper to be sure that we're going to be using it on a global scale.

Another piece of all this has to do with location of battery manufacturer and battery swaps. So it's already the case, I know for the Nissan Leaf, that there's a fair number of aftermarket batteries being made not from recycled material made outside the US and you can swap your battery out for one of these sort of aftermarket ones and it holds a charge again. So that's great. Breathe some new life into the car, but you're potentially using a battery that's been sourced where the materials have been sourced in a much worse way than the original one. And so when you start thinking about the global scale and the movement of vehicles, which particularly in Europe and Asia is tremendous. So high income countries in Europe and Asia, export lots and lots of used vehicles to lower income countries near them. So South Asia, North Africa, Middle East, receive a lot of these used vehicles. And the question is, can we enforce the same standards on the battery replacements there as we can maybe enforce on the standards for the original equipment batteries that were installed? And if we have trouble doing that, then how much should we worry about that? How do we deal with that?

__Pranav (13:21):__
Just had a quick question, a quick follow up question. We noticed that in some of your research you talked about vehicle scrappage and similar things. Maybe not directly related to this problem of battery recycling, but in the problem of scrapping or reuse of materials, have you seen any successful policies that might be looked into further?

__Professor Jacobsen (13:45):__
Yeah, so I guess that's the pessimistic economist in me coming out, which is that the most successful recycling is of something like steel for cars. If you take an old EV and crush it up, that steel will be recycled almost a hundred percent for sure. And the reason that it happens is because a cheaper way to get steel than to make it from iron ore. The policy that we want to imagine is to take some recycling that's not economical, that does actually cost a bit extra, and make sure that that happens. And that's where globalization and some of your questions about outsourcing and so on really start to enter. Certainly there've been successful recycling policies in California, for example, where a lot of old electronics now are recycled in the state that hadn't been before. That's the closest thing to the batteries that comes from heavy subsidization from the state government. And we can sort of do that. But the question is can you do that on a global scale or not, right? Or do you end up with kind of leaks in the system?

So it could be that some countries mandate that new cars, new electric cars come with batteries that are X percent recycled 20%, 50%, whatever, you pick some number, you can increase the number over time, there could be a very well enforced regulation. But then the question is can you, and so that's some recycling happening, but then can you enforce that regulation everywhere? Can you reinforce it on aftermarket batteries and so on becomes much, much harder. I'm trying to think of what the sort of best example of a successful recycling policy is. Yeah, I suppose mean plastic deposit refund schemes are getting pretty many plastic single use plastic bottles back in California now. I believe I saw more than half of them come back and get recycled instead of going in the ocean or landfills or wherever else sort of bad that we don't want them. So that kind of thing can work, but California is not the rest of the world, and so it's hard to you, it's hard to know how you think of a US-wide [system], right? So what kind of recycling system in the US is the most successful? Well, aluminum cans get recycled almost everywhere in the us, but again, that's economical, right? Recycling aluminum can actually brings in money. It's cheaper than making fresh aluminum. Recycling a plastic bottle is not necessarily so economical, right?

__Clayton (16:31):__
So going back, tying it in with affordable costs that often typically results with cheap labor, in some cases. With the outsourcing of mining labor, do economists often considered trade restrictions on countries who allow unethical labor practices to happen within their borders?

__Professor Jacobsen (16:57):__
So the WTO has done some of those. It will take action against various types of labor violations overseas and enforce penalties on it. You see, by outsourcing the labor for mining, I trust you mean by sort of importing the minerals from elsewhere that could have had a mine in the US, but you could also have had a mine somewhere else and we end up with the mine somewhere else most of the time, right?

__Clayton (17:27):__
Yeah.

__Professor Jacobsen (17:29):__
So yes, so you see it pretty often on branded products. So if a particular brand has a problem in one of its factories with utilization of illegal labor of one sort or another, that brand will get punished not only by trade organizations but also by its consumers. So people will become aware and boycott it and punish it, kind of that way. The issue is with commodities. So things like oil for example, there's this big effort to restrict all the oil coming out of Russia, for example. But that's, a lot of countries are trying to do that in a lot of different ways. But the problem is oil is a commodity. Once it's left the original port, it becomes hard to distinguish one barrel of oil from another. So a branded product you know you can sort of follow it around and see where it ends up. But a commodity becomes much more interchangeable with other similar commodities. And so enforcing these kind of restrictions is harder. It's still possible. There are cases where it's done, but it becomes tougher.

There's a common problem in fishing, for example, where you imagine reducing phishing in a well-regulated country. Say, pick some European country with well-regulated fishery. It decides that there's too much harmful practice in this fishery or whatever. And so it closes, it restricts fishing there. The problem often is that that expands a fishery elsewhere in the world with even worse practices than the bad practices and the one being closed. And so you end up having to choose between bad and even worse, and this is a likely to be a problem with minerals extraction as well, is that you end up kind of slowing down or stopping development of new mines in places in some places that actually would've maybe constructed the mine in a reasonably friendly way, would've only half destroyed the river or something. And then you end up with the mine in a place that completely destroys it.

And so this is called the pollution havens hypothesis, goes way back in the environmental economics literature, that if you have trade that so-called pollution havens will emerge where dirty industries, mining industries and so on, kind of congregate in places with weak environmental rules. And you can also end up with sort of races to the bottom that everybody wants to have the weakest environmental rules so that they can get the most industry coming in and get the most jobs and so on. In general, the literature finds people have looked for this, right? Then statistically they say, well, this should happen, and in theory there's an incentive there for this sort of bad practice to happen. Does it actually happen? And there's been a number of studies, there's some evidence for it happening, but there's also a lot of evidence that it doesn't seem to be as bad as we thought.

A lot of outsourcing is also modernizing at the same time. So you end up closing kind of an old mining operation or an old power plant in one place and opening a brand new one in a place that yes has weaker environmental rules, but the brand new one still ends up being cleaner than the old one you closed. Even though the environmental rules are weaker just because it's using modern technology that's more efficient in production and so on. So there's also some silver lining in outsourcing in that it helps the capital stock turn over more quickly. So you're using more modern technology, which is often cleaner in newer operations.

__Clayton (21:23):__
Yeah, it sounds very neat. Good.

__Professor Jacobsen (21:28):__
Yeah, so there's lots of interesting questions. I think that the thing with electric vehicles that's being talked about is scale. So I think that's really something to kind of pay attention to is just how large these operations are going to need to be. So you think about the global petroleum industry, mostly driven by transportation. It's an enormous industry. It's so big that we've had many, many movies made about it. And it's sort of a piece of the common, everybody thinks about oil companies or has thought about at some point in their life about oil companies and what they do and where they are and oil producing countries and non oil producing countries and so on. It's such a huge part of just our current state. If that all becomes about lithium and battery production, who are the battery exporters and the minerals exporters, right? The scale is just tremendous. And so that's the thing I'd really encourage you think about. Right now a lot of mining is kind of not that huge an industry. It's confined to a few countries and a few really bad mines and so on. This is about to become a really big industry that many, many countries are involved in. And so I think scale is quite important.

__Clayton (22:45):__
I mean, especially when I was doing research on this, lithium is becoming very highly demanded in the industry because of all this renewable technology and cell phones. There's just a lot more things it could be incorporated in.

__Professor Jacobsen (23:07):__
Using a lot more of it for all our electronic gadgets and now we're really going to be using a lot more of it. And so yeah, to the extent we can extract it reasonably cleanly and keep cycling it, recycling it, that could be okay. To the extent that it ends up being used more like an exhaustible resource, where it's just cheaper to get it fresh, then I think we face a much more difficult process with it.

__Clayton (23:39):__
Pranav, do you have any more questions?

__Pranav (23:47):__
You talked a little bit or we talked a little bit about the economics and how you mentioned that a lot of the issue is also a technological issue. Is there such a process that would make say lithium recycling similar to aluminum or steel recycling, which I'm not familiar with it, but I guess it's much more efficient and cost friendly. So I guess in your opinion, because you're an expert, is the state, looking good as far as the developments in it or is there more pessimistic view on that sector?

__Professor Jacobsen (24:38):__
I think that we need to focus effort on research in that direction. So a huge amount of funding and effort is going into R&D on the cars themselves and other aspects of renewable energy. And finding now a lot of effort on R&D is just going into finding new lithium reserves, a lot of private capital going in there. There's very little private capital that I know of going into trying to improve recycling processes for lithium. But it just seems like this is a clear example where it'd be a good idea to try and spend some money on basic research now, to get those processes working such that we don't need as much freshly mined material in the future. I will hold out some hope for it, though. It is pretty expensive. It is metal, so most of the really successful recycling has been with metals and things that are more easily refined back to something close to their original state. Plastic, it's really hard to get it back to its original state. Even when you're recycling plastic, you end up with different length polymers and chains and they often end up making into products that are not the same as the original product. Whereas the metals, typically when we recycle the metals, we can get them really pure again and then make them right back into the original thing. And so I don't know much about the chemistry or the physics involved in doing it, but it does strike me that there's some hope because it is in some sense more similar to things like aluminum steel than it is to something like plastic, which is a much more complicated structure.

__Pranav (26:26):__
Yeah. Well that was my last question. Clayton, do you have anything else?

__Clayton (26:30):__
No, I think that's it it.

__Professor Jacobsen (26:32):__
Great.

__Clayton (26:33):__
Yeah. Thank you so much for making time for us. Thank you very much. Really appreciate it.

__Professor Jacobsen (26:38):__
Good luck with the analysis and the film. So yeah. Bye.

__Pranav (26:43):__
Thank you. Bye.
