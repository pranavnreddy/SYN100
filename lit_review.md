# The Role of Consumption in Driving Climate Change
Consumption plays an important role in the fight against climate injustices. Consumerism has a largely negative effect on the health of the environment. As a result, buyers must be more aware of the goods they consume. As the world population increases more materials are harvested to produce our needs. This act of overproduction is unsustainable. Studies predict that 80% of the world's natural resources that are currently being harvested are being consumed by only 20% of the population (Netimpact). This unevenly distributed proportion of natural resources is ultimately due to the increasing popularity of consumer capitalism. Some countries like the United States have much larger rates of consumption compared to other countries. According to the Global Footprint Network, if everybody on Earth had a similar rate of consumption as the average American we would need about five Earths to sustain ourselves. The normalization of these overconsumption practices are highly unsustainable. These Industries are estimated to be the cause of 23% of greenhouse gas emissions (EPA). This is primarily the result of the massive amounts of energy required to produce products from raw materials. The world cannot continue to sustain these industry practices. Corporations or government institutes need to invest in researching new ways to make the harvesting of these materials more sustainable.

# Outsourced Labor and Dsiability
Disability studies have been historically concentrated in the western world, and due to this bias have suffered from a focus on western concerns (Meekosha). In her article on decolonizing disability, Helen Meekosha identifies several ways in which disability studies obtain a special quality outside of the western nations. The prevalence of disease, especially in childhood, war, and manual labor without mechanization form the “production of disability.” In the context of labor, sweatshops, which “offer cheaper wages, little or no trade union protection, and poor health protection” are major producers of disability, burning workers out within as little as 5 years. Additionally, women are often employed in sweatshops, adding a gendered dimension to these issues. Another popular industry that is exported is recycling and waste processing, which relates to the vast amount of consumer waste, especially electronics, which combines the concerns of pollution and disability. 

Firstly, we can observe the effect of climate change on life expectancy, which can serve as a proxy for disability. Since disability is a biological category, we can see how the same conditions which affect life expectancy affect disability and its production (Mallet). The metric of disability-adjusted life years shows the effects of climate change on the production of disability in a quantitative manner (Zhang et al). The most prominent factor is disease and lack of medication, which is primarily the intellectual property of the western world, and therefore hard to obtain in poorer countries, showing the way in which this issue is intersectional.

In the modern era, mining is a central industry that is outsourced to the first world (Santiago). Workers in the third world extract minerals like copper and lithium, which they are ironically unable to purchase. This also contains a political element, as historically the US has enforced austerity programs and supported oppressive regimes in the interest of maintaining the low-cost extraction of minerals and petroleum. However, the response of communities to this should be noted. Indigenous groups in Ecuador filed a lawsuit against Chevron for environmental damages, and are presently still fighting a legal battle for reparations. Bolivia has resisted the calls for opening its vast lithium reserves to “extractivism,” rejecting the notion that mining equals development.

Beyond labor itself, there is a peripheral industry which supports those laborers. As a case study, the mining of coltan involves various armed groups which control the flow of minerals, as well as a network of women who face violence from the aforementioned groups (Shapiro). This adds a gendered aspect to our analysis, as men who often work in these mines form a patriarchal system which enables widespread sexual violence against women. In the DRC, rape has been described as a weapon, which armed groups used to terrorize and suppress resistance, as well as enforce the system of heteropatriarchy that assists in the maintenance of coltan extraction. In addition, the pervasive sexual violence produces a social aspect to disability, as victims are often shunned by their community, family, and even their husbands, in addition to the scars of the sexual violence. 
A new perspective on disability involves the consideration of how colonization developed the conditions of disability and how those conditions differ from those in the western world. Additionally, noting that disability is the result of “the continued dependency on the northern metropole. Exploitative and dangerous work conditions are closely tied to the political economies inherited from colonial rule.” 

# Environmental Effects of Lithium and Coltan Extraction
The mining of Lithium has a negative effect on the environment. Lithium is typically mined by drilling into underground saltwater reservoirs and then letting it dissolve to separate the minerals to be easily harvested. In order to transfer these minerals a lot of power and water is needed to get them to processing plants (BorrumEnergy). The power used to control the flow of water is typically not environmentally efficient, taking up more power than needed. In countries like Chile the government has not implemented environmental laws focused on clean energy so the massive lithium industry in Chile has no incentive to spend money in order to make the mineral transportation environmentally friendly. Mining activities in Chile “consume 65 percent of the region’s water, which is having a large impact on local farmers” (IER). As a result, local rivers and lakes are disappearing due to these corporations transferring the water to their processing plants (NRDC). With the removal of water in this dry environment, the land  is transforming into a desert-like habitat. This has nearly forced all of the native population from their homes due to the fact that they cannot grow grain or feed their livestock. In these countries it seems that these corporations have more authority over natural resources than the lower class citizens. In the rainy seasons these lithium extraction plants often overflow and runoff into major lakes and rivers resulting in dangerous contamination (Lithium Future). These contaminants have a serious effect on the biodiversity in the surrounding environment. Due to the relatively recent demand for lithium the extent of its environmental impact is not yet known. 

Coltan is also an ore that has had a devastating impact on the environment. Primarily mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the coltan industry mines for the ore by hand. The mining of coltan has caused irreparable damage to tropical forests, contaminating water sources, and local wildlife (CulturalSurvival). The biggest contributor to climate change in the commodification of coltan is through energy consumption. Coal is used to melt the ore, releasing dangerous particles that endanger the environment. The burning of fossil fuels is the greatest contributor to climate change.

# The Role of Companies and Products
The production of modern electronic devices requires a variety of minerals and chemical elements. The list of ingredients includes copper, nickel, manganese, graphite, lithium, cobalt, neodymium, and many other, often exotic, elements (Lotzof). The extraction of such resources is frequently labor intensive and causes mass environmental devastation, as well as secondary effects on the region including ecosystem loss, groundwater pollution, and aridification.

Additionally, the next wave of “green” technologies depends on the use of the aforementioned elements. For example, neodymium is critical for the miniaturization of magnets, which enable low-power and smaller devices. Lithium is especially important for its role in battery production, which is expected to be extremely important for green transitions. Companies like Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft depend on battery technology to make their consumer devices work.

However, these companies can claim ignorance of their sourcing. Due to the way that mining works in the third world, end-chain companies like Apple can legitimately say that they do not know who extracted these resources or where it takes place. Although the Dodd-Frank Act technically requires companies to report on their relationship with so-called conflict minerals, regulations are porous and the aforementioned obfuscation provides a legal shield for many of these companies.
